/**
 * airplay_core — the boundary between the vendored airplay-esp32 protocol
 * stack (plain C, ESP-IDF) and the ESPHome media source (C++).
 *
 * The core knows nothing about ESPHome. It talks to its host through the
 * callbacks in airplay_core_host_t, and the host drives it through the
 * functions below. Everything in this header is safe to call from C++.
 *
 * Threading:
 *   - host.write() is called from the core's playback task.
 *   - host.on_event() and host.on_volume() are called from core tasks
 *     (RTSP connection task). The host must marshal to its main loop.
 *   - airplay_core_notify_played() is called from the host's speaker
 *     callback task and must stay cheap (it only updates atomics).
